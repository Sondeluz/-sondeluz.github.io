Hello! My name is ~~IÃ±igo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!~~ Samuel, and I am a CS graduate from Universidad de Zaragoza, with an MSc. in Intelligent Interactive Systems from Universitat Pompeu Fabra. I'm mainly interested in AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Semantic Web, which you will see reflected in my various projects!

My main hobbies are books (Science fiction & fantasy, mostly) and cult movies. Feel free to ask me about Terry Pratchett, Joe Abercrombie and Brandon Sanderson :)
